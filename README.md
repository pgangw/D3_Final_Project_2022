# The environmental cost of fashion
### A website report using interactive visualizations created with D3
This is a classroom project created in the month of December 2022 at Pratt Institute, NYC. 

## 01. About the project
The environmental impacts of the fashion industry are widespread and substantial. The [Fashion Revolution](https://www.fashionrevolution.org) is the world’s largest fashion activism movement, mobilizing citizens, brands and policymakers through research, education and advocacy. Their [“fashion transparency index”](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=fashion+transparency+index&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) is a tool to rank the world’s largest fashion brands and retailers based on what information they disclose about their social and environmental policies, practices and impacts, in their operations and supply chain. The Index is a tool to push and incentivise fashion brands to be more transparent about their social and environmental efforts as it is foundational to achieving systemic change in the global fashion industry. The research study scores brands on various transparency indices with varying weights. 

**This interaction visualization project will focus on the environmental impact metrics captured in the study.** 

The project will answer the research questions -
- Which companies/fashion brands perform the best/worst in terms of sharing information on their environmental impact transparency metrics charted out by fashion revolution?
- What are the scores of each of the companies across the transparency sub-segments?

## 02. Data source

The scores of each of the brands in the study, across categories have been sourced from the website. The excel sheet with the scores was filtered according their relevance with impact on the environment.

## 03. Design rationale

The visualization is designed to allow viewers to understand the context and the dataset before jumping into the visuals. There are hence a couple of starter slides added that share information on the relevance of the topic and provides a link to the raw dataset.

## 04. Project documentation

**04 The topmost and the least sustainable brands**
This visual lists the brands according to the highest and lowest total scores (scroing out of 32). Viewers can sort the visuals in ascending or descending order (also colored accordingly).
